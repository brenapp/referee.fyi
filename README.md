# [Referee FYI](https://referee.fyi)

Referee FYI is a digital anomaly log for Head Referees in robotics competitions.
Referee FYI allows you to record violations quickly, see summaries before a
match, and share your log with others. It designed to replace the paper entries
referees would use before, and is meant to complement existing competition
technology tooling.
